JupyterLite is a JupyterLab distribution that **runs entirely in the browser** built
from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

## ‚ö° Status ‚ö°

Although JupyterLite is currently being developed by core Jupyter developers, the
project is still _unofficial_.

Not all the usual features available in JupyterLab and the Classic Notebook will work
with JupyterLite, but many already do!

Don't hesitate to check out the
[documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/index.html) for more
information and project updates.

## ‚ú® Try it in your browser ‚ú®

JupyterLite works with both [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) and
[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).

You can build your own JupyterLite website in a couple of minutes, with custom
extensions and packages.

# TCP Analysis Project

This repository contains 9 files, including the main analysis in the `TCP.ipynb` file, with 8 supporting files that detail the steps and learning process.

## How to Run the Project with JupyterLite

To connect and run the code in your browser without installing anything locally, follow these steps:

1. Visit [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/try/lab).
2. Upload the `TCP.ipynb` file along with the 8 supporting files.
3. Open `TCP.ipynb` within the JupyterLite interface.
4. Execute the cells to perform the analysis directly in the browser.
